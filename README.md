# ili9341-cmd
Yet another library to control the ili9341 display controller.

The code is based on the [lcd-ili9341](https://crates.io/crates/lcd-ili9341) crate and influenced by the [ili9341](https://crates.io/crates/ili9341) crate.

It is focussed around completeness and supports the command interface only.
The idea is to provide a complete control interface to simplify glueing it to any graphics library.
